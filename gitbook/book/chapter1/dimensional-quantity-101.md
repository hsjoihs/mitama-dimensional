Dimensional Quantity 101
------------------------

## Unit systems

----------------------------

There are three basic unit systems in use today:

- the International System of Units (SI units, from Le Systeme International dâ€™Unites, more commonly simply called metric units)
- the English Engineering System of Units (commonly called English units)
- the British Gravitational System of Units (BG)

This library only supports SI units by library default.


## Base units and dimensions

----------------------------

Base units have the important property that all other units derive from them.
In the SI system, there are seven such base units and corresponding physical quantities:

- meter (m) for length,
- kilogram (kg) for mass,
- second (s) for time,
- kelvin (K) for temperature,
- ampere (A) for electric current,
- candela (cd) for luminous intensity, and
- mole (mol) for the amount of substance.

## Mathematical Notation

----------------------------

We need some suitable mathematical notation to calculate with dimensions like length, mass, time, and so forth.
The dimension of length is written as [ $$L$$ ], the dimension of mass as [ $$M$$ ]  and the dimension of time as [ $$T$$ ].
The dimension of a derived unit like velocity, which is distance (length) divided by time, then becomes [ $$LT^{-1}$$ ] in this notation. The dimension of force, another derived unit, is the same as the dimension of mass times acceleration, and hence the dimension of force is [ $$MLT^{-2}$$ ].

Now let's think about multiplication and division of dimensional quantities.
For example,

$$
a [m] \times b [s] = c [m \cdot s]
$$

$$m \cdot s$$ is a new unit different both of metre and second.
And can give a clear meaning that $$m \cdot s$$ is proportional to both of metre and second.

And $$m / s$$ is proportional to metre and inversely proportinoal to second.
Also, $$m /s \times s$$ derives $$m$$.



## Dimensions of common physical quantities

----------------------------

Many derived quantities are measured in derived units that have their own name. Force is one example: Newton (N) is a derived unit for force, equal to $$kg \cdot m \cdot s^{-2}$$.
Another derived unit is Pascal (Pa) for pressure, i.e., force per area.
The unit of Pa then equals $$N/m^2$$ or $$kg \cdot m^{-1} \cdot s^{-2}$$.

Below are more names for derived quantities, listed with their units.

## Mtric Prefix

----------------------------

A **metrix prefix** is a unit prefix that precedes a basic unit of measure to indicate a multiple or fraction of the unit.
Each prefix has a unique symbol that is prepended to the unit symbol.
The prefix **kilo-**, for example , may be added to gram to indicate multiplication by one thousand; one kilogram is equal to one thousand grams.
The prefix **mili-**, likewise, may be added to metre to indicate division by one thousand; one milimetre is equal to one thousand of a metre.

The SI prefixes are standardized for use in the International System of Units (SI units).
