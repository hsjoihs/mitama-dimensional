## Dimensional Quantity 101

### Introduction

{% hint style='info' %}
In this section, describes dimensional quantity based on physical quantities.

There is a difference between dimensions and units. A dimension is a measure of a physical variable (without numerical values), while a unit is a way to assign a number or measurement to that dimension.

For example, length is a dimension, but it is measured in units of feet (ft) or meters (m).

There are three basic unit systems in use today:

- the International System of Units (SI units, from Le Systeme International dâ€™Unites, more commonly simply called metric units)
- the English Engineering System of Units (commonly called English units)
- the British Gravitational System of Units (BG)

Basic dimensions and SI units
In total, there are seven basic dimensions. Basic dimensions are defined as independent or fundamental dimensions, from which other dimensions can be obtained.

The basic dimensions are: mass, length, time, temperature, electric current, luminous intensity, and amount of substance. For most mechanical and thermal science analyses, however, only the first four of these are required. The others will not be of concern to most mechanical engineering analyses. Electric currency is used in electromagnetic engineering analyses and amount of substance is used in chemical engineering analyses.

In order to assign numbers to these basic dimensions, basic units must be assigned. These are listed in the table below for the SI unit systems:

|   Base Dimension    |   SI unit    |
| :-----------------: | :----------: |
|        mass         | kg(kilogram) |
|       length        |   m(metre)   |
|        time         |  s(second)   |
|     temperature     |  K(Kelvin)   |
|  electric currency  |  A(ampere)   |
| amount of substance |  mol(mole)   |
|  lminous intensity  | cd(candela)  |
