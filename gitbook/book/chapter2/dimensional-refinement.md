# Dimensional refinement
----------------------


defined in header [`<dimensional/refinement.hpp>`]().

## Refinement type

A function that can be guaranteed at compile time to have dimensions in accordance with the purpose while inferring units of quantity type.

The following is a compilation error if the quantity `(2 | meters) * (7 | meters)` does not have the dimension of area $$L ^ 2$$ completely.
This code can be compiled through refinement, since $$m ^ 2$$ is of dimension $$L ^ 2$$.

```cpp
quantity_t a1 = refined<area_r> |= (2|meters) * (7|meters);
```


If you want to specify the unit should be written as follows. The difference is that automatic unit conversion is performed when units are different.
`refined` examines only the dimensions, not the units.


```cpp
quantity<meter_t, int> a1 = (2|meters) * (7|meters);
```



The following example does not pass compilation. This is because m is the dimension of $$L$$ and not $$L ^ 2$$.

```cpp
quantity_t a3 = refined<area_r> |= (2|millimeters); // error!
```

## Partial refinement type

The following is a compilation error if the quantity `(2 | meters) * (2 | meters) * (2 | kilograms) / (2 | second <2>)` does not partially have the dimension of mass $$M$$.
The compilation passes because it actually has.

```cpp
quantity_t a3 = partial_refined<sym::M<>> |= (2|meters) * (2|meters) * (2|kilograms) / (2|second<2>);
```
